Hello!! 
My name is Aesha and i'm a final year cybersecurity Student.
This repo is to showcase any projects i've done so far
My first project is a keylogger


**Simple Keylogger**

This file contains a Python-based simple keylogger that records keystrokes into a file named log.txt. It uses the pynput library to listen for keyboard events.

•	The script listens for key press and release events using the pynput.keyboard module.
•	Characters are captured as they are typed on the keyboard.
•	Only printable characters (letters, numbers, symbols) are recorded.
•	The recorded characters are appended to the log.txt file located in the same directory as the script.
•	Pressing the Escape key stops the keylogger.
